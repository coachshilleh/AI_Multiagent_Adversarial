# AI_Multiagent_Adversarial

# Involves a multiplayer capture-the-flag variant of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. Each team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on their home side. I used a star and defined multiple search problems to solve this contest.
